I started receiving a lot of error notifications recently from my ExceptionNotfier plugin for an error with ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken.  It turned out the error was occurring because one of my users was pasting a link to my app in an MS Office document and when Office sees the link it makes a request that Rails could not handle.  Here I'll show you a simple fix you can use to avoid these errors with much credit going to an article at <a href="http://rails.learnhub.com/lesson/2318-dealing-with-microsoft-office-protocol-discovery-in-rails"><br />Dealing with Microsoft Office Protocol Discovery in Rails<br /></a>.<br /><br />My execptions looked something like this (lots of boring details omitted)<br /><br /><pre><br />A ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken occurred in events#1164:<br /><br />  ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken<br />  [RAILS_ROOT]/vendor/rails/actionpack/lib/action_controller/request_forgery_protection.rb:86:in `verify_authenticity_token'<br /><br />-------------------------------<br />Environment:<br />-------------------------------<br />  * HTTP_USER_AGENT        : Microsoft Data Access Internet Publishing Provider Protocol Discovery<br />  * REQUEST_METHOD         : OPTIONS<br /></pre><br /><br />The problem is that Rails doesn't understand the method 'OPTIONS' (see <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/ce56c5daa81d61a745b88220014a846a0eea46a4/actionpack/lib/action_controller/routing.rb">rails/actionpack/lib/action_controller/routing.rb</a><br /><br /><pre><br />#around line 270 of routing.rb<br />module ActionController<br />  module Routing<br />    HTTP_METHODS = [:get, :head, :post, :put, :delete]<br />  end<br />end<br /></pre><br /><br />Fixing the problem is fairly simple.  You insert a before_filter into your application controller to intercept and handle requests with the option method before the rails code realizes it can't handle the request.<br /><br /><pre><br />class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base<br />  before_filter :options_for_microsoft_office_protocol_discovery<br /><br />  ...<br /><br />  def options_for_microsoft_office_protocol_discovery<br />    render :nothing => true, :status => 200 if request.method == :options<br />  end<br />end  <br /></pre><br /><br />Its also easy to write a simple spec in rspec to verify the behavior.  There is one trick which is that rails/actionpack/lib/action_controller/test_process.rb defines helper methods for get, post, put, delete &amp; head that we can't use so we need to call the underlying method directly but the signature for that underlying method changed with Rails 2.3 (<a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/6e2a771661a47fb682108648244837f8616e350d">commit</a>) so depending what version you're using you'll need one of 2 flavors.  <br /><br /><pre><br />  # Rails 2.3 and above <br />  it 'should not throw an exception on OPTIONS request (from ms office protocol discovery)' do<br />    process '/any/goofy/path', nil, nil, nil, 'OPTIONS'<br />    response.should be_success<br />  end <br /><br />  # Rails < 2.3 version<br />  it 'should not throw an exception on OPTIONS request (from ms office protocol discovery)' do<br />    @request.env['REQUEST_METHOD'] = 'OPTIONS'<br />    process '/any/goofy/path'<br />    response.should be_success<br />  end <br /></pre><br /><br />You can also test from the command line using curl<br /><br /><pre><br />curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost:3000/<br /></pre><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Update:</span> It turns out that Rails stores the acceptable methods in 2 different places <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/b1c989f28dd1d619f0e3e3ca1b894b686e517f2f/actionpack/lib/action_controller/request.rb">actionpack/lib/action_controller/request.rb</a> which does include all of get head put post delete options and also (see <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/ce56c5daa81d61a745b88220014a846a0eea46a4/actionpack/lib/action_controller/routing.rb">rails/actionpack/lib/action_controller/routing.rb</a> which only includes :get, :head, :post, :put, :delete (options is missing).  This means this fix will only work for OPTIONS requests and not any other type as ActionController::Request request_method will throw an exception before getting to the filter code above.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/86313661235162475-5516259370645936062?l=www.alexrothenberg.com' alt='' /></div>
