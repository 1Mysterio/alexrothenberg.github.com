Great quote from <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/01/31/quality-doesnt-matter-that-much-jeff-and-joel">Uncle Bob</a> (near the bottom of the post)<br /><br /><blockquote>I think that maintaining your technical chops is a full time job. For that reason I have avoided becoming a business wonk. I hire people to do that for me so I can keep my technical skills as sharp as possible and remain relevant to my profession. I donâ€™t believe I can offer technical advice unless I am living that technical advice.</blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/86313661235162475-2419345969142927990?l=www.alexrothenberg.com' alt='' /></div>
