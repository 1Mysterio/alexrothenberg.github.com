# About Me (Bio)
![Alex Rothenberg](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f4252ea05ddfbeb7b1803e9941ea46aa)

Alex has over 15 years experience developing software for small startups and in the enterprise. 
In all contexts he strives to find simple, common-sense solutions to complex problems. 
Although he is a committed Rubyist he often has to find ways to coexist with legacy technologies 
and applications in the IT department at a large enterprise.

Alex spoke at OSCON 2010 [Off the Beaten Path: Using Rails in the Enterprise](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/13664)
