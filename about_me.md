# About Me (Bio)

Alex has over 15 years experience developing software for small startups and in the enterprise. 
In all contexts he strives to find simple, common-sense solutions to complex problems. 
Although he is a committed Rubyist he often has to find ways to coexist with legacy technologies 
and applications in the IT department at a large enterprise.
